# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **machine learning regression model** to predict the selling price of cars based on various features such as brand, model year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and ownership details.
The goal is to assist users and businesses in estimating a fair car price using historical data.

* Random Forest Regressor

---

## 🔍 Methodology

1. Data cleaning and handling missing values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature encoding and scaling
4. Train-test split (80:20)
5. Model training and comparison
6. Performance evaluation using regression metrics

---

## 📈 Model Performance

* Achieved **R² Score: ~0.87** on test data
* Reduced **RMSE by approximately 25%** after feature engineering
* Random Forest Regressor performed better compared to Linear Regression

---

## 📐 Evaluation Metrics

* R² Score
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

---

## 🚀 Results

The final model provides reliable car price predictions and demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world regression problems in the automobile domain.
